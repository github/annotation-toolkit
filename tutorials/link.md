# How to: **Link**

Links are interactive elements that provide the user with a way to navigate: a section of the same page, a different page within the same website or to a new website, a different to a resource such as a PDF or image, a user's phone app to quick dial a number, or a user's application to start a new message.

## Why?

Links are the backbone of the web. They’re not interchangeable with Buttons, which primarily control actions rather than navigation.

The semantic `<a>` element provides a lot of functionality and information for users. Any custom link controls must behave in the same expected ways, including: 

- Navigate to the destination.
- Update the browser's address field, page title, and focus.
- Open the destination in a new window/tab whether hard coded or the native browser option is used.
- Able to be activated with the Enter key, but not the Space key. The Space key should scroll the page.
- Allow the destination/URI to be copied and bookmarked in the browser.
- Appear in a screen reader’s list of all links on a page.
- Automatically add where the user has been in their browser’s history.
- The browser’s back and forwards buttons function as expected.
- Communicate a visited state when users have already been to the destination.

## Link Stamps and Details

### [Annotation Tiers](https://github.com/github/annotation-toolkit/blob/main/deep-dives/tiered-model.md)
- Difficulty Tier 1: **Easy**
- Priority Tier 1: **Mandatory**

The second is a blue bracket stamp with a label of Link and a note number set to 2. The third is a blue lasso stamp which has a white and blue dashed outline attached to it, a label of Link, and a note number set to 3. The last is annotation is a Link Details component with a note number set to 4. It is a white rectangular panel with blue accents and information about the HTML element, the link target, and the type of link (set to use a mailto protocol)." src="Images/link-annotations.png" width="1012">

### Variants

#### Skip link

Allow users to bypass repetitive content and jump directly to specific sections of a page. 

Skip links help keyboard (and screen reader) users bypass blocks of content that are repeated across pages. 

Make sure skip links have a clear destination, such as the main landmark region.

Below this is Details annotation with blue accents showing the HTML element and the target (which is set to open in the same window). Below both is an exposed Figma component property toggle for Skip link, which is inactive. On the right is a dark blue Pin Stamp with a label of Skip Link, a note number set to 3 and a chain link icon with a fast-forward arrow icon in the corner. Below this is a Details annotation with dark blue accents showing the HTML element and the destination (which has placeholder for an element ID or name of a section). Below these is an exposed Figma component property toggle for Skip link, which is active." src="Images/skip_link.png" width="679">

### How to use these annotations

**1.** ​Add a **❖ Link Stamp** component from the asset panel. Place the stamp over the design frame and resize to extend pin, bracket, or lasso. Configure the component properties as needed:
  - **Label position:** Set based on Stamp’s placement relative to the element being annotated.
  - **Skip Link:** Toggle if this link is only visible on focus and helps keyboard users bypass repetitive content.
  - **Show Number:** Toggle off if there’s no need for a matching Details annotation (in which case, skip step 2).
  - **Note number:** Set this number in relative sequence with the other numbered Stamps placed over the same design.

**2.** ​Place a **❖ Link Details** component in the margins next to the design and configure the component properties as needed:
  - **Note number:** Set this to match the corresponding **❖ Link Stamp**. This number should be unique and in relative sequence with other Details annotations on the same design.
  - **Accessible Name:** Programmatic label for the link when the visible text is insufficient. This can be implemented as an `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, or through `visually-hidden` (or `“sr-only”`) styling.
  - **Description:** Specify a target for `aria-describedby` if needed.
  - **Target:** Defaults to same window. Can be changed to new window for use cases when it’s essential, such as when avoiding form data loss. This option should be used rarely.
  - **Type of Link:** Use the `Telephone number`, `Email address`, or `Downloadable` options to add semantics that ensure these types of links operate properly.
  - **Destination (skip link only):** Enter the element ID or name of section the skip link should point to.

There are also properties for link target (set to open in same window) and the type of link (set to default)." src="Images/Link-details.png" width="557">

## Design considerations

- What design element is a link?  
- Does it have a visual or icon that conveys meaning?  
- Does it open in the same or new tab?
- Does it download a file or open an app?
- Is it a linked image? What alt text would describe the destination?
- Are there multiple links with the same visible label? How can they be differentiated?
