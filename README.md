# Welcome to the GitHub Annotation Toolkit

The GitHub Annotation Toolkit is a Figma asset library packed with components to help you organize your design canvas, diagram UI anatomy, and annotate accessibility details. Whether you’re a designer, developer, or product manager, this toolkit meets you where you are—you don’t need to be an accessibility expert. It’s flexible enough to document broad accessibility considerations or dig into the fine details of complex components.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Tell us what you think!** We would love your feedback and [contributions](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to help improve the Annotation Toolkit, including any examples of how you’ve used or customized this library. Just open an [issue](https://github.com/github/annotation-toolkit/issues) in this repository. GitHub staff can reach out via Slack.

## What are annotations and why do we use them?

Annotations are notes included in design projects that help make the unseen explicit. They convey design intent that isn't immediately obvious from visual elements alone, improving the usability of digital experiences by providing developers with a holistic picture of how an experience should function. Think of annotations as a visual aid for basic code semantics—they help show how designs should function under the hood. 

When annotations are part of our design process, our teams work better together. They're a collaboration tool that can help:

- Close communication gaps
- Prevent quality issues
- Avoid accessibility audit issues
- Eliminate expensive re-work

They can also be used in early design explorations or wireframes to validate functionality. If you find it difficult to annotate a wireframe, that's often a sign that deeper thinking is needed about how the UI should work.


## Requirements

A paid Figma plan is recommended in order to use the components as an asset library. 

The components in this library support web as well as mobile (iOS and Android) platforms.


### How to use the Annotation Toolkit library in your design files
If not already available in your list of libraries, Publish and enable from the Assets tab. 

Find the "Annotation Toolkit" library in the Figma Asset panel. This is enabled by default for all internal GitHub design files. For older files, you enable the library by following [these instructions](https://accessibility-playbook.github.com/enabling-a11y-design-toolkit-library-in-figma).

| <img width="642" height="254" alt="The Manage Libraries dialog in Figma, showing the Annotation Toolkit listed under Team Libraries" src=".images/Readme-publish-library-1.png" /> |
|--------|
| Publish to your Figma instance and add to your file. |

| <img width="642" height="277" alt="The Manage Libraries dialog in Figma, showing several sets of components from the Annotation Toolkit" src=".images/Readme-publish-library-2.png" /> |
