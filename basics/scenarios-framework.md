# Scenarios Framework in the Annotation Toolkit

Some types of annotation Details components have optional fields to add links to Scenarios Framework issues. The Scenarios Framework is an internal GitHub initiative and a work in progress. 

Scenarios are a simple way to describe the functionality of a GitHub service, with each scenario focusing on a single task that a user may want to complete. The Framework offers a process for identifying these scenarios and a structure for documenting them consistently.

GitHub staff can find more info in the `github/scenarios` repository.
