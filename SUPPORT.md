## How to file issues and get help

This project uses GitHub issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please search the existing issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates. For new issues, file your bug or feature request as a new issue.

To get help, submit bugs, ask questions, or make feature requests, create an Issue in this repository. 

The Annotation Toolkit is under active development and maintained by GitHub staff. We will do our best to respond to support, feature requests, and community questions in a timely manner.
