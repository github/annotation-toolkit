## How can you contribute to the Figma library

We would love your feedback and contributions to help improve the Annotation Toolkit. As they're often used on proprietary and unreleased work, tools like this tend to be built and used in isolation. If you have customized this library for your own use, you can help this open source tool grow and evolve so that others can benefit from your innovation. **We are happy to consider integrating ideas you've explored in your own library forks and submitted as a new [issue](https://github.com/github/annotation-toolkit/issues).** 

Due to how Figma handles open source files, we can only take _direct_ contributions from **GitHub staff**.

## GitHub staff contributions

1. To make changes you first need to create a new branch from Annotation Toolkit by selecting “Create branch...” from the dropdown or via the command palette. Name it `@username/changes-being-made`. For example: `@ericwbailey/update-basic-annotations`.
2. When you are satisfied with the changes you made, request a review from the maintainers. If you are not sure who that is, reach out in the `#annotation-toolkit` slack channel. Add a detailed message describe what you changed and why.
3. Once your branch is approved, a maintainer will take care of merging and publishing the changes to the library.

We use this process to make sure no accidental changes get added to the library. It also allows us to better track changes added by a branch. Think of it as a repo that does not allow direct pushes to the main branch.

### Merging contributions (for maintainers)
Only maintainers with editor rights can merge contributions.

#### Process for merging branches
1. Reset the main file to the latest release or the last time a branch was merged by hovering over the item, clicking the dots to show the more menu and selecting “restore version”.
2. Open the branch and review & test everything to make sure it works
3. Open the review window by clicking on the “In Review” badge next to the name
4. Make sure there are no conflicts
5. Merge the branch

### Publishing changes (for maintainers)
Only maintainers with editor rights can publish changes.

#### Process for publishing releases
1. Select “Publish library” from the dropdown next to the file name.
2. In the dialog check that all changes that will be published are valid.
3. Add a very descriptive description. This will be part of the release notes later so make sure to include what was changed and why.
4. Press the “Publish” button and your release is done.
